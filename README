This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1205

Modified from the original syntax/java.vim to support syntax folding. I also removed a lot of unncessary syntax defs including error detection, standard classes, etc.


Known issues:

- Method declaration is also folded currently, this is very ugly...
